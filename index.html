          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This digital portfolio showcases a rich handful of experiences that
            have built my competence as an engineer. This portfolio highlights
            three main components that I believe all engineers must have in
            order to be prepared for their field. Each section will highlight
            examples from my personal and professional journey to demonstrate my
            achievement within each attribute.
          </p>
          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
            I am the eldest of a first generation family and the first in my
            extended family to ever attend college. I was born in Guanajuato,
            Mexico. My love for math and genuine passion for the community
            propelled me into such an accomplishment. However, it was my
            commitment to building a better world for my family and my
            community, through a mission-driven career, that encouraged my
            mentors to introduce me to engineering. The curiosity, imagination,
            love for learning and the success with hands-on environments both as
            a child and as an adult led me to dive into the challenge. I now
            have two degrees, teaching and mechanical engineering. These degrees
            make me a qualified and passionate graduate of Seattle University
            seeking an opportunity that aligns with my mission and vision as an
            engineer.

              <h3>Code the Dream Programming Course</h3>
              <p>
                Applied and got accepted into intro to programming course to
                learn Javascript. Works with excellent mentors and is provided a
                myriad of resources to be successful in learning to code. The
                course consists of weekly assignments that build on each other
                to create a portfolio as the end result of the course.
                Additionally, there is a comprehensive exam at the end to ensure
                learning of important coding concepts and to determine if
                student can move onto the advanced course.
